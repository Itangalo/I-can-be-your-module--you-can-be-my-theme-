I CAN BE YOUR MODULE (YOU CAN BE MY THEME)
------------------------------------------


---
It feels so lonely late at night
  wrapping up a piece of code
Looking for some beauty in life
  but there's no API for theme_love_load()
The code might be clean and safe
  but there's something missing
There's too little Drupal love
  my code needs hugging and kissing


---
I can be your module, you can be my theme

I can be your module, you can be my theme


---
Slowly giving up on the Color module
  and everything just seems blue
Can't you see, see Ð 'kay Ð
  Can't you see that I need you?
The patch is green and it's performing well

But there's no pretending Ð we all can tell
  I might be smart but it's ugly as hell


---
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme


---
I am nothing without you
A displayless View
A marine without the blue
  Yeah

I'm an action with no hook
I'm a crime without a crook
I'm a pageless book
  Yeah

I'm a string without t()
I'm a pod without a pea
I'm a value without key
  Yeah

I'm the drush I didn't make
I'm a cookie without cake
I'm a power ballade
  without a solo break Ð yeah!


---
*awesome solo*


---
Wrapping up some code late at night
  pushing up a final commit
Looking for some beauty in my life
  but I don't know how to get it
Time to get some sleep and reboot my brain

The keyboard is finally silent
  but the monitor is screaming of pain


---
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
I can be your module, you can be my theme
  Again and again and againâ ...
